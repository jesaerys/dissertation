Introduction
============

- Start with this question: What can we learn about a stellar population
  looking only at its light?

  - "stellar population": some collection of stars, probably associated in some
    way (cluster, star-forming region, a galaxy, etc.)

  - "light" => "integrated light": the total light from some specific
    wavelength range (red, green, UV, etc.)


- modeling light form stars: stellar population synthesis

  - stellar isochrones: given what we know about gravity, thermonuclear
    processes, and radiative and convective energy transfer, chemistry, etc.,
    we can model how a star of a given mass and composition will evolve with
    time in terms of its luminosity and temperature.

  - stellar spectra: at each point in a star's evolution, we can use the same
    physics to model what the spectrum of star's emitted light will be.

  - initial mass function (IMF): empirical relationship describing the number
    of stars in a stellar population as a function of mass.

  - simple stellar population (SSP): if we know how individual stars evolve,
    what their spectra look like at each evolutionary stage, and how many stars
    can be expected at each mass, then we can model the combined spectrum of a
    group of stars called an SSP (all formed at effectively the same time, in
    the same place, from the same material).

    - think clusters.
    - SSPs are the building blocks for modeling more complex stellar
      populations.

  - star formation history (SFH): stars are continually forming and dying such
    that any given stellar population is more complex than a single SSP, but
    rather the sum of several generations of SSPs. The history of star
    formation in a population is quantified as the evolution of star formation
    rate (SFR) and metallicity vs time.

    - "star formation rate", SFR, is the rate at which stars are formed from
      the gas in a given environment (stars have a lifecycle: they live for a
      while, they die, new ones are born). It is typically measured in solar
      masses (the mass of one sun) per year, Msun yr-1.

  - The SSP spectrum at a given age combined with information about the total
    mass formed at each age results in a spectrum for the combined, or
    composite, stellar population (CSP)

  - dust: The CSP spectrum should also take into account the effects of dust
    (absorbing high energy photons, emission in the infrared).

- to summarize, we can use SPS to predict the spectrum from a stellar
  population assuming,

  - stellar evolution models
  - stellar spectra models
  - IMF
  - dust properties
  - SFH, total mass



- clever people have used SPS to develop relationships for estimating various
  characteristics about an observed stellar population given its integrated
  flux.

  - "various characteristics": namely, mean age, total mass, and star formation
    rate.
  - SSP color vs age
  - SSP age and luminosity => mass
  - SFH with constant SFR and metallicity => SFR


- my overall research statement (in plain language!): how well can the
  integrated light from a stellar population predict such characteristics about
  that population?

- who cares?

  - SFRs are routinely estimated using integrated flux in extragalactic
    astronomy. (Most galaxies are far too distant for us to resolve their
    stellar content.)
  - Comparing with resolved stars provides a "ground truth" assessment of this
    technique.
