My advisor, Evan Skillman. Knowledgeable, has good advice (academic and life),
has provided me with great opportunities (PHAT, travel to converences).
Flexible, understanding, patient. Good example of work-life balance.

My comrades. Friendship is important. Grad school is hard and help each other
get through it, even if just by kicking back every once in a while.

My parents. Have always been so supportive from the beginning. Have helped me
out so many times along the way, allowing me to focus on earning my degree.

My wife. Look to her for inspiration to keep going. I remember when we both
started our professional studies at the U; we had no idea what challenges were
ahead of us. Starting a family while still in school... This has truly been the
most challenging time in my life, and she's been there for me through all of
it. We've been through so much together.
