University thesis template
==========================

An archive containing the latex thesis template and example document can be
obtained at http://www.grad.umn.edu/students/ThesisSubmission/index.html . (If
the link changes in the future, one should be able to find it by searching the
UofM website for "thesis template", "thesis submission", or something similar.)
Although the archive is named MASTERS, it is also be used for PhD
dissertations. The main files are,

- mnthesis.cls : The actual thesis template.
- thesis_masters.tex : The main tex file that pulls all of the other source
  files together.
- title.tex : The source file for the title page. It also illustrates some of
  the commands defined in mnthesis.cls and pulls in content for the abstract,
  acknowledgments, and other special thesis things.

Also included are the hunsrt.bst bibliography style file and bigstrut.sty
package for tables, but these don't have to be used. The other files are just
example tex source files for the actual thesis content.



Making latex work as expected
=============================

Chances are the dissertation won't be written from scratch. Rather, each
previously or soon-to-be published paper will be make up a separate chapter of
the dissertation. And, chances are, these papers have been written using
aastex.cls or emulateapj.cls and some collection of packages imported with
``\usepackage`` (e.g., amsmath and related pacakges are fairly common). The
goal, then, is to import this prewritten content into the thesis document with
as little effort as possible. Packages should still work as expected; just use
the same ``\usepackage`` commands in thesis.tex and hopefully there won't be
any conflicts with mnthesis.cls. Most often, however, the challenge is that
mnthesis.cls does not know or care about conventional use of latex in
astronomy, so familiar things like natbib/bibtex and deluxetable simply aren't
available. Here are some workarounds to avoid painful fights with latex.


aastex stuff
------------

Some things, e.g., being able to use ``\apj`` in a bibliographic definition,
are fairly ingrained and it would be nice to use them in the thesis document.
One solution is to pull out all of the relevant bits from aastex.cls [1]_ and
create a custom package that can be loaded in thesis.tex. Conveniently, former
grad Pete Mendygral has already done this in a file called aastex_hack.sty
[2]_, which makes available just about every journal abbreviation and symbol
from aastex, as well as the ``\plottwo`` environment. aastex also calls on
amssymb.

The deluxetable environment is technically part of the aastex class file, but
Alexey Vikhlinin has created a package called deluxetable.sty that can be
loaded separately [3]_.

To use these packages, add these lines to thesis.tex::

  \usepackage{aastex_hack}
  \usepackage{amssymb}
  \usepackage{deluxetable}


natbib and bibtex
-----------------

aastex implicitly uses natbib, and many people like to use bibtex so that they
can manage their references in a separate file. To get these working with the
thesis template, just copy natbib.sty [4]_ and apj.bst [5]_ into the working
directory, and then include these lines in thesis.tex::

  \usepackage{natbib}
  \bibliographystyle{apj}


Figures
-------
aastex uses the graphicx package, so in thesis.tex add the line, ::

  \usepackage{graphicx}

Existing papers
===============

- Strip out the preamble, adding whatever is necessary to the preamble in
  thesis.tex, and get rid of the document environment.
- Change ``\title{...}`` to ``\chapter{...}``. Should probably add a ``\citep``
  to the end of the title if it is a published work.
- Get rid of authors (``\author``, ``\shortauthors``), affiliations
  (``\altaffiltext``), ``\thanks``, ``\keywords``, etc.
- Change ``\begin/end{abstract}`` to ``\begin/end{quote}``. Inside the quote
  environment, add something like::

    \begin{center}
    \textbf{\large Abstract}
    \end{center}

- Explicitly setting ``\figurenum`` doesn't work. Use
  ``\addtocounter{figure}{...}`` instead.
- ``\begin/end{deluxetable*}`` is not available. Use the standard
  ``\begin/end{deluxtable}`` instead.
- Use something like ``\tabletypesize{\footnotesize}`` right after entering the
  deluxetable environment for better font size in the table.
